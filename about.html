        <h3>CHAD COOK <span class="text-secondary">BIO</span></h3>
        <p><strong></strong>My name is Chad Cook and I recently graduated from UNC Charlotte Full Stack Web Development course. The course was one of the most difficult yet rewarding experiences of my life. I have developed a passion for development and I look forward to continuing my learning for the rest of my career. I'm excited to jump into the software development field and start making a difference to users around the world.</p>
        <p>The last 6 1/2 years have been spent working in the Refrigerated Transportation field in Charlotte, NC. Most of this time has been spent in Rental Management. I managed over 100 trailer assets and have increased profits year over year. My passions and interests include Mountain Biking, Hiking, 4WD Offroading and Personal Finance. I look forward to applying my past employment and personal interests to software projects going forward.</p>
